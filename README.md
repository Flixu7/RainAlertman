# RainAlertman

No bullshit weather alert bot. Every morning at 6 AM it checks if it’s raining in your city and shoots you an SMS. Simple, effective, done.

## How it rolls

- Scheduled GitHub Action wakes it up daily  
- Calls weather API to sniff rain  
- Twilio sends you the SMS – no surprises  
- Config via `.env` – keep your keys secret, idiot-proof

## Setup

1. Clone.  
2. Drop your creds in `.env`.  
3. Push and relax.

## Why?

Because waking up soaked sucks. Now you’ll know.

Just a tool. No fluff.
